# Integrating Intent Understanding and Optimal Behavior Planning for Behavior Tree Generation from Human instructions (IJCAI 2024)

[[Website]](https://dids-ei.github.io/Project/LLM-OBTEA/)

This repository contains the code for our project, which is divided into three main sections:

1. **LLM Folder**: This directory contains the code for the Large Language Models (LLM). It encompasses all the scripts and modules necessary to run and implement the large-scale language model functionalities of our project.

2. **OBTEA Folder**: Here, you will find the code for the Behavior Tree Backward Expansion Algorithm (OBTEA). This section includes the implementation details and the necessary scripts for executing the behavior tree-based algorithms.

3. **RoboWaiter Folder**:  It contains code for deploying our algorithms in a café's digital twin scenario, showcasing the practical application of our research in simulating and enhancing café service operations.
